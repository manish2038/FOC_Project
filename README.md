Testing:
1. After defining every function, checked for errors by running the function with simple inputs.
2. Defined the map and gave multiple inputs for every single function.
3. Connected all the functions with the main function that takes the intial or starting room as white room as defined in the map.
4. After adding to the main function, gave sample inputs and tested.

Issues could not be resolved: Not able to add the iterative function as given an example in the Abbreviation sections using the ambig.map

Difficult issue: 
- Experienced many key errors and type errors when defining a variable current_room in the main function that takes the starting room as input.
- I defined a start room variable and assigned the start variable from the loop.map file and made the current_room take the value of the newly defined start room variable.

Extensions:
1. help Verb:
	- help function is defined that gives the user an idea of what commands a user can run.
	- the user has to run the help command to get the list of commands

2. Directions become verbs:
	- Instead of the command "go {dirrection}" a shortcut for the directions are defined as verb that can be given as an input.
	- Example: Instead of "go north" command, a user can give "n" as an input command that does the exact same functionality as "go north".
	- Example: Instead of "go east" command, a user can give "east" as an input command that does the exact same functionality as "go east".

3. drop verb:
	- drop function is created to drop items from the inventory.
	- the user can drop few items from the inventory that he feels unrequired by using the drop function by using the command "drop {item}"
