Testing:
1. After defining every function, checked for errors by running the function with simple inputs.
2. Defined the map and gave multiple inputs for every single function.
3. Connected all the functions with the main function that takes the intial or starting room as white room as defined in the map.
4. After adding to the main function, gave sample inputs and tested.

Issues could not resolve: Not able to add the iterative function as given an example in the Abbrevaiation sections using the ambig.map

Difficult issue: 
- Experienced many key errors and type errors when defining the a variable current_room in the main function that takes the starting room as input.
- I defined a start room variable and assigned the start variable from the loop.map file and made the current_room take the value of newly defined start room variable.
